# Python Exercises: Array Manipulation and Transformation

Welcome to my Python exercises repository! This collection focuses on mastering array manipulation and transformation using NumPy. Each exercise is designed to enhance your skills in creating, sorting, searching, adding, and deleting elements in a NumPy array. Additionally, explore transformations between arrays and lists, and delve into percentile calculations.

## Exercises Overview

### 1. Creating and Manipulating Arrays

- **Create Array:** Generate NumPy arrays with diverse data.
- **Sort Array:** Learn techniques for sorting elements in arrays.
- **Search Element:** Implement methods for searching elements in arrays.
- **Add and Delete Elements:** Explore adding and deleting elements dynamically.
- **Transformation to List:** Convert NumPy arrays back to Python lists.

### 2. Advanced Operations

- **Define 'no_duplicados':** Create a NumPy array with non-duplicated data.
- **Equally Divide:** Divide the 'no_duplicados' array into 'n' spaces.
- **Percentiles:** Calculate percentiles for the array.

## Usage

Explore each exercise independently to strengthen your skills in array manipulation. Code snippets and explanations are provided to aid your understanding. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code for further learning.
